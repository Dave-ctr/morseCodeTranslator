A simple app to translate Morse Code to English and vice versa.

<!-- 
You’re tasked with creating a morse code translator. It should be able to translate based on user input from the DOM. This should allow users to type English words/sentences into an input box and receive the morse code translation. 

Consider how you will store the morse characters in JS to make translation easier.

All of your functions should be tested, with the tests written first.

Remember to make a plan/pseudo-code before diving right in.

As an extension it should be able to translate both ways.
The logic for translating both ways won’t be exactly the same but there might be similarities between the two translators (Morse => English, English => Morse)
 
Goals
1. A working Translator: The main task is to create a tested Translator not only will this test your understanding of JavaScript but how you break down a problem.

2. Practice using Git: We want you to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line... so REGULAR COMMITS :D
   
3. Apply what you are learning: This is a great place to apply what you have been learning on all of the course so far. When you get it functioning really push on the UI, use SCSS, BEM, anything else you find on the web....really go mad!

Requirements
Translator functions and Unit tests to be written in separate files. Functions to be brought into the main.js and unit test files.

We expect at least 10 Git commits for the different stages in your development.

We would like you to take a Mobile first approach to the implementation. It needs to work on different device widths.
